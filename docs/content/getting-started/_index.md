title: Getting started
---

If you are reading this, you have decided to follow the journey of a non-system admin setting up an academic research lab's computational stack.
I am not making any claims that this is **the** way to setup a computational cluster, but it is technically a "working" way.
My learning is primarily done through teaching and writing documentation, so this supplements my goldfish memory and _maybe_ helps you&mdash;somehow.

LabStack may be helpful if you (**a**) have more than two _somewhat_ powerful computers and (**b**) want to spend many, many hours learning, setting up, and maintaining the cluster instead of spending money on your local high-performance computing (HPC) organization or common cloud computer platforms.
Or if you just want to learn sys admin stuff; that is cool too.
